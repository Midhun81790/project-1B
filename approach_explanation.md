# Approach Explanation: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Problem Understanding

The challenge requires building a system that extracts and ranks relevant sections from PDF collections based on specific personas and job requirements. The key insight is that different personas (PhD researchers, investment analysts, food contractors) need different types of information from the same documents.

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Multi-Method Text Extraction
Our approach uses three complementary extraction methods:
- **Header-based extraction**: Identifies document structure using formatting cues and common section patterns
- **Paragraph-based grouping**: Groups related paragraphs when clear headers aren't available  
- **Sliding window approach**: Ensures comprehensive coverage for documents with minimal structure

This multi-method approach ensures robust section extraction across diverse document types and formats.

### 2. Persona-Driven Relevance Scoring

The core innovation is our persona matching system that:
- **Classifies personas** into domains (academic, business, technical, food, travel, HR) and specific roles
- **Extracts job requirements** from task descriptions using NLP techniques
- **Builds keyword profiles** with weighted importance based on persona and job type
- **Calculates relevance scores** using keyword frequency, context, and semantic analysis

### 3. Multi-Factor Ranking Algorithm

Sections are ranked using five weighted scoring components:
- **Relevance Score (40%)**: Persona-specific keyword matching and contextual relevance
- **Quality Score (25%)**: Content readability, structure, and information density
- **Completeness Score (15%)**: Presence of specific details, examples, and actionable information
- **Position Score (10%)**: Document position bias (early sections often contain key information)
- **Uniqueness Score (10%)**: Content differentiation to avoid redundancy

### 4. Intelligent Subsection Analysis

For top-ranked sections, we perform refined analysis to extract the most relevant subsections by:
- Identifying high-quality paragraphs using domain-specific criteria
- Combining related content for better context
- Ensuring extracted text provides actionable insights for the specific persona

## Key Technical Innovations

**Offline Operation**: Uses lightweight NLP models (NLTK) instead of large transformer models to meet size constraints while maintaining accuracy.

**Performance Optimization**: Efficient text processing algorithms and smart caching ensure sub-60-second execution times.

**Domain Adaptability**: Extensible keyword profiles and scoring algorithms adapt to different domains and use cases.

This approach delivers accurate, persona-specific document intelligence while meeting all performance and deployment constraints.
